# AsyncClick

[AsyncClick][] is a fork of Click that works well with [anyio][], [Trio][], or [asyncio][].

# Click

Click is a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces
in a composable way with as little code as necessary. It's the "Command
Line Interface Creation Kit". It's highly configurable but comes with
sensible defaults out of the box.

It aims to make the process of writing command line tools quick and fun
while also preventing any frustration caused by the inability to
implement an intended CLI API.

AsyncClick in four points:

-   Arbitrary nesting of commands
-   Automatic help page generation
-   Supports lazy loading of subcommands at runtime
-   Seamlessly use async-enabled command and subcommand handlers


## A Simple Example

```python
import asyncclick as click
import anyio

@click.command()
@click.option("--count", default=1, help="Number of greetings.")
@click.option("--name", prompt="Your name", help="The person to greet.")
async def hello(count, name):
    """Simple program that greets NAME for a total of COUNT times."""
    for x in range(count):
        if x:
            await anyio.sleep(0.1)
        click.echo(f"Hello, {name}!")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    hello()
```

```
$ python hello.py --count=3
Your name: Click
Hello, Click!
Hello, Click!
Hello, Click!
```

Compared to the original [Click][], you'll note that AsyncClick supports
optional(!) sprinkling of `async`/`await` keywords wherever your code needs
them.

In the interest of not diverging from Click more than absolutely necessary,
many examples have not been touched.
